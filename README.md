# multi-pi-videoplayer

A set of python script to control multiple videos on multiple raspberry pi's from a single server Pi. There are many methods to do parts of this but nothing simple and complete that I found. The goal for this project is a complete how-to setup for controlling multiple Pi's for use in art installations or kiosk type applications.
